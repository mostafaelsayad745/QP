print("🎯 Key Benefits:")
print("• Forms automatically adapt to available screen space")
print("• Minimum sizes ensure forms remain usable on small screens") 
print("• Maximum sizes prevent forms from becoming too large on huge screens")
print("• Forms expand to full window width - no more 'cornering' issues")
print("• Centered positioning provides consistent user experience")

print("\n📋 Form Layout Improvements:")
print("• 90 canvas patterns fixed with width configuration")
print("• All major windows now use responsive sizing")
print("• Forms properly expand to fill available width")
print("• Scrolling only for height overflow, not width issues")
print("• Consistent behavior across all 26+ forms")
